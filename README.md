#  Custom KNN Algorithm

I followed the below steps  to implement k-Nearest Neighbors in Python

Handle Data: Open the dataset from Text file , converted in to Dataframe , and added column names,
            treated  misiing values and split into test/train datasets.

Similarity: Calculate the distance between two data instances.

Neighbors: Locate k most similar data instances.

Response: Generate a response from a set of data instances.

Accuracy: Summarize the accuracy of predictions.

Compare : Compare the Acuuracy and timing with Sklearn KNN algorithm

Balance : Blancing the data using SMOTE model , re run the alorithm and comapre Custom and Sklearn algorithms peroformances
