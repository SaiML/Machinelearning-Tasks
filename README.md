Questions are as follows :

a.	Which talks provoke the most online discussion ? 
b.	Visualize the distribution of comments using histograms to see the frequency distribution of talks having comments > 1000 and  < 1000. Is there a outlier effect? Justify your statements
c.	Plot the number of talks happening each year. Show their distribution as well (Hint use unix timestamp conversion).
Also calculate the average delay between filming and publishing. 
d.	What were the best events in TED history to attend as per the dataset? Justify your answer
e.	Unpack the ratings column (Hint : Use either ast library or construct a new dataframe for ratings column)

 for each talk, calculate the percentage of ratings that were negative
 for each talk, calculate the average number of ratings it received per day since it was    published
g.   Which occupations deliver the funniest TED talks on average? (Answer maybe
