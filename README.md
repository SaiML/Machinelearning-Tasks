# Custom KNN Algorithm implementation in Python
The k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is one of the most fundamental and powerful Algorithm to understand, 
implement and use in classification problems when there is no or little knowledge about the distribution of data.

It is also called as Lazy Algorithm,  it keeps waiting untill the new data point comes for testing , it then calulate the
distance from that test point to all training points and deicides on the shortest Distance measures

Custom Knn involved the below functions 
1. Function for Training and Testing split of data
2. Calculating  euclidian Distances among test to train data points 
3.Function for Prediction of class by Sorting the votes by using a counter
4. Function for Caluclating Accuracy 
5. Function for All other Clasification Metrics 

# comparing time complexity and Accuarcy with SK learn KNN
we have compared the Custom Knn with the SK learn Knn algorithm in terms of Time taking to run the code and Acuarcy of models

# Balancing the Data
Balance the Data by using the SMOTE model and calculated the Metrics for both Custom knn and SKlearn Algorithms

# Changing the Class Probability
We have changed the Probabilities of class to several cutoffs and tried to check out the Accuracy at each cutoff
